Este conflicto con Caputo se debe en gran medida a los ataques que Gerardo Werthein, canciller desde el 18 de abril de 2024, recibió por parte de los “tuiteros” que apoyan al asesor de Milei.

Según explican en La Nación, el canciller esperaba una defensa pública por parte del primer mandatario que nunca llegó. Esto propició su decisión de dimitir el cargo previo a las elecciones nacionales para renovar bancas en el Congreso. La renuncia se hará efectiva el lunes 27. 

Aún no hay reemplazo definido: Nahuel Sotelo, Úrsula Basset, Luis María Kreckler, Guillermo Francos, son todos nombres que se barajan, pero ¿quiénes son?

● Nahuel Sotelo es el actual secretario de Culto.

● Úrsula es la directora de Derechos Humanos de la Cancillería.

Ambos son mencionados por el grupo “Las fuerzas del Cielo” que apoyan de cerca al presidente. 

● Luis María Kreckler es cónsul en San Pablo y tiene buen vínculo con Karina Milei.

● Guillermo Francos, pero sólo si Caputo toma su lugar como Jefe de Gabinete post elecciones.

2. To provide financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.
3. According to the European Accounting Association:

Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance.

> The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value.

Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

## Faithful Representation

The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error.

## Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics

## Statement of cash flows

The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance

| Cash Inflow | Outflow   | Opening Balance |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| _Monday_    | `Tuesday` | **Wednesday**   |
| 1           | 2         | 3               |

**Example 1:** in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:

- Cash inflow: $20
- Cash outflow:$7
- Opening balance: $5
- Closing balance: $20 – $7 + $5 = $18

**Example 2:** in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:

> **Important:** the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.

## Statement of financial position (balance sheet)

The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement.

- **fixed assets**
  - property
  - building
  - equipment (such as factory machinery)
- **intangible assets**
  - copyrights
  - trademarks
  - patents
    - pending
    - international
- goodwill

Owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.-->
